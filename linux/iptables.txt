# tables, chains and targets

The packet filtering mechanism provided by iptables is organized into three different kinds of structures: tables, chains and targets.

## Tables

* filter
It is used to make decisions about whether a packet should be allowed to reach its destination.

* mangle
alter packet headers in various ways

* nat
route packets to different hosts on NAT (Network Address Translation) networks by changing the source and destination addresses of packets.

* raw
work with packets before the kernel starts tracking its state.



## Chains
Tables are composed of chains, which can filter packets at various points.

* PREROUTING chain:
apply to packets as they just arrive on the network interface. 

* INPUT chain:
apply to packets just before they’re given to a local process.

* OUTPUT chain:
apply to packets just after they’ve been produced by a process.

* FORWARD chain:
apply to any packets that are routed through the current host.

* POSTROUTING chain:
apply to packets as they just leave the network interface. 


## Targets

Targets decide the fate of a packet.

### Terminating targets: ACCEPT, DROP and REJECT

* Decide the fate of packets inmmediately

* DROP vs REJECT
DROP: iptables drops the packet. To anyone trying to connect to your system, it would appear like the system didn’t even exist.
REJECT: iptables “rejects” the packet. It sends a “connection reset” packet in case of TCP, or a “destination host unreachable” packet in case of UDP or ICMP.

### Non-terminating targets: LOG
